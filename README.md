## Why Pindrop?

While other dictation apps compromise on privacy, performance, or platform fidelity, Pindrop is designed specifically for Mac users who refuse to compromise.

## Features

- **100% Local Transcription** — Runs entirely on your Mac using OpenAI's Whisper model via WhisperKit. Your voice never leaves your computer.

- **Smart Output** — Text is automatically copied to your clipboard and optionally inserted directly at your cursor.
- **Transcription History** — All your dictations are saved locally with full search. Export to JSON, CSV, or plain text.
- **Multiple Model Sizes** — Choose from Tiny (fastest) to Large (most accurate) depending on your needs.
- **AI Enhancement (Optional)** — Clean up transcriptions using any OpenAI-compatible API—completely optional and off by default.
- **Custom Dictionary** — Define custom word replacements and vocabulary to improve transcription accuracy for names, jargon, and specialized terms.
- **Beautiful macOS Design** — Native SwiftUI interface that feels at home on your Mac.

---

## Built With

- **[Swift](https://swift.org/)** — Apple's modern, fast, and safe programming language
- **[SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/swiftui/)** — Declarative UI framework for truly native Mac apps
- **[WhisperKit](https://github.com/argmaxinc/WhisperKit)** — Core ML implementation of OpenAI Whisper by [Argmax, Inc.](https://www.argmaxinc.com/)
- **[SwiftData](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftdata)** — Modern data persistence framework
- **Just one external dependency** — WhisperKit. Everything else is Apple's first-party frameworks.

## Requirements

- **macOS 14.0 (Sonoma) or later**
- **Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4)** recommended for optimal performance
- **Microphone access** (required for recording)
- **Accessibility permission** (optional, enables direct text insertion; clipboard works without it)

## Installation

Since Pindrop is currently distributed as a self-signed build, you'll need to approve it on first launch:

1. Download `Pindrop.dmg` from the [releases page](../../releases)
2. Open the DMG and drag Pindrop to Applications
3. **First launch only:** Right-click Pindrop → Open
4. If you see "cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified":
   - Open System Settings → Privacy & Security
   - Scroll to "Security" section
   - Click "Open Anyway" next to Pindrop
   - Enter your password when prompted
5. Pindrop will now launch normally

**Why this happens:** Pindrop is self-signed because we don't have an Apple Developer account yet. The app is completely safe - this is just macOS being cautious about unverified developers.

## Building from Source

Since this is an open-source project, you can also build it yourself. Don't worry—it's straightforward.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/watzon/pindrop.git
cd pindrop
```

### Step 2: Open in Xcode

```bash
open Pindrop.xcodeproj
```

Or simply double-click `Pindrop.xcodeproj` in Finder.

### Step 3: Build and Run

1. In Xcode, select a scheme from the toolbar (Pindrop should be selected by default)
2. Press `Cmd+R` or click the Run button
3. The app will compile and launch

After the first build, Pindrop will appear in your menu bar (look for the microphone icon). The app runs exclusively in the menu bar—no dock icon.

### Using the Build System (Recommended)

This project includes a `justfile` for common build tasks. Install `just` if you haven't already:

```bash
brew install just
```

**Common commands:**

```bash
just build              # Build for development (Debug)
just build-release      # Build for release
just test               # Run tests
just dmg-self-signed    # Build + create self-signed DMG
just clean              # Clean build artifacts
just --list             # Show all available commands
```

**Release commands (maintainers):**

```bash
just release 1.5.5  # Bump version, commit, tag, push → triggers CI
```

### Manual Build (Alternative)

To create a distributable build manually:

```bash
xcodebuild -scheme Pindrop -configuration Release build
```

The compiled app will be in `build/Release/Pindrop.app`.

### Creating a DMG

To create a distributable DMG (self-signed):

```bash
just dmg-self-signed
```

This requires `create-dmg`:

```bash
brew install create-dmg
```

The DMG will be created in `dist/Pindrop.dmg`.

### Creating a Release

Releases are built via GitHub Actions. To create a new release:

```bash
# 1. Bump version, commit, tag, and push (triggers CI)
just release 1.5.5

# 2. Wait for GitHub Actions to complete
#    Watch: https://github.com/watzon/pindrop/actions

# 3. Publish the draft release on GitHub
#    https://github.com/watzon/pindrop/releases
```

## First Launch

When you first open Pindrop, you'll see an onboarding flow:

1. **Grant Microphone Permission** — Required for recording dictations
2. **Download a Model** — Start with "Tiny" for the fastest experience (about 75MB)
3. **Set Up Your Hotkey** — Default is Option+Space for toggle mode
4. **You're Ready** — Press your hotkey and start dictating

## Usage

### Recording Modes

**Toggle Mode** (default: `Option+Space`)

- Press once to start recording (menu bar icon turns red)
- Press again to stop and transcribe
- Your transcribed text appears in your clipboard immediately

**Push-to-Talk**

- Hold your hotkey to record
- Release to stop and transcribe
- Configure a different hotkey in Settings → Hotkeys

### Output

Transcribed text is always copied to your clipboard. If you've granted Accessibility permission, it's also inserted directly at your cursor in the active application.

### History

Access all your past transcriptions:

- Click the menu bar icon → History (or press `Cmd+H`)
- Search through any transcription
- Copy individual entries or export to JSON/CSV/plain text

## Settings

### General

- **Output Mode**: Clipboard only, or clipboard + direct insertion
- **Language**: English (more languages coming in future updates)

### Hotkeys

- Configure your toggle hotkey and push-to-talk hotkey
- Press the "Record New Hotkey" button and press your desired keys

### Models

| Model  | Size    | Speed   | Accuracy |
| ------ | ------- | ------- | -------- |
| Tiny   | ~75 MB  | Fastest | Good     |
| Base   | ~150 MB | Fast    | Good     |
| Small  | ~500 MB | Medium  | Better   |
| Medium | ~1.5 GB | Slower  | High     |
| Large  | ~3 GB   | Slowest | Highest  |

Start with Tiny or Base for daily use. Switch to Medium or Large when you need maximum accuracy.

### AI Enhancement

- Toggle AI-powered text cleanup on/off
- Enter any OpenAI-compatible API endpoint
- Your API key is stored securely in the macOS Keychain—not in UserDefaults

## Troubleshooting

### App doesn't appear in menu bar

Pindrop is a menu bar-only app—it intentionally has no dock icon. Look for the microphone icon in the top-right corner of your menu bar.

### Microphone permission denied

1. Open **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Microphone**
2. Enable permission for Pindrop
3. Restart the app

### Direct text insertion not working

1. Open **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility**
2. Click "+" and add Pindrop
3. Restart the app
4. Clipboard output still works without this permission

### Transcription is slow

- Use a smaller model (Tiny or Base)
- Make sure you're on Apple Silicon (Intel Macs are supported but slower)
- Close other resource-intensive applications

### Model download fails

- Check your internet connection
- Ensure you have enough disk space (75MB–3GB depending on model)
- Try downloading again from Settings → Models

### Hotkey doesn't work

- Check for conflicts with other apps
- Try a different key combination
- Click the menu bar icon first to ensure the app has focus
